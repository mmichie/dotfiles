dotfiles
========

These are my Linux dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.  They
were hand tailored for me, so understand what you are doing before blindly using
them.  No warranty provided.

Hopefully I don't check in something sensitive here.

Install Instructions
===================

These are intended to be used with GNU Stow.  Once you clone the dotfiles repo,
run:

```./install_dotfiles.sh```
