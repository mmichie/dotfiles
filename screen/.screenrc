# Q: My xterm scrollbar does not work with screen.
# A: The problem is that xterm will not allow scrolling if the alternate text buffer
# is selected. The standard definitions of the termcap initialize capabilities ti
# and te switch to and from the alternate text buffer. (The scrollbar also does not
# work when you start e.g. ?vi?). You can tell screen not to use these
# initialisations by adding the line ?termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@? to your ~/.screenrc
# file. 
termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@
