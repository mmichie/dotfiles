# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored

#
# To use this file:
# 1. Copy to ~/.config/clima/wifi-locations.conf
# 2. Edit with your WiFi networks and their locations
# 3. The zsh wifi_location module will automatically detect your current WiFi
#    and set CLIMA_LAT and CLIMA_LON environment variables
#
# Example entries:

# Home WiFi
# MyHomeNetwork,37.7749,-122.4194

# Office WiFi

# Coffee Shop
# StarbucksWiFi,37.7858,-122.4064

# Notes:
# - SSID must match exactly (case-sensitive)
# - Latitude and longitude should be decimal degrees
# - Get coordinates from: https://www.latlong.net/
# - Only the first matching SSID will be used
# - If no match is found, clima will fall back to IP-based location
