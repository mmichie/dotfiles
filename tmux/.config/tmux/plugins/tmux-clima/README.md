**Clima (Esperanto for weather) is a simple plugin that displays the local
weather conditions and temperature in your Tmux status line.**

By default, the location is obtained automatically using your IP address. You can it set to a specific location using an
option `@clima.location`

Results are cached for 15 minutes by default.

## Requirements

### OpenWeatherMap API key

The weather information is provided by
[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). To use this plugin you need a
valid OpenWeather API key that can be request
[here](https://openweathermap.org/api).

An environment variable named `OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY` with the API key value
should be exported to use this plugin:

```bash
export OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY="[API-KEY-VALUE]"
```

You can add this to your shell configuration or source it from any other file.

and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) installed.

## Install

Then add the plugin to your `~/.tmux.conf`:

```tmux
set -g @plugin 'vascomfnunes/tmux-clima'

## Usage

set -g status-right "#{clima}"
```

Current weather details can be visualized using `prefix + W`, which will display
a standard tmux message with additional weather details:
